### Part 2 (75 pts)

I believe, in this instance, it would make sense to communicate this issue to your boss. Because this issue could harm people’s safety, it should not be kept secret. You should tell your team and boss. If they do not address the problem within a reasonable amount of time, you should go to the higher echelon of the company: your boss’ boss. Going to the public would put your company’s stocks, people’s safety, and your career at risk. It should not be done. If the product is not yet released and people’s safety is at stake, I can understand the desire to go public: to feel the urge to do what you perceive as right. However, because the implications of this issue have wide reaching effects, it would be prudent to consult a team; as one person cannot conceive all outcomes. Even more, if you have given your word or signed an NDA, to renege is unethical. I believe using proper channels to fix a problem is the best option. Additionally, since this is a private company, there are likely government entities with which communicate with: public safety is their obligation. These agencies are within the scope of proper channels. Hounding all those who are privy to the information to fix the issue is ethical and proper. I would also argue it is required of you. However, circumventing those channels is improper and unethical and it may has unforeseen consequences. If you refrain from action, you are responsible, as it is your job and responsibility to report the issue. If you address it with your boss, company and, if applicable, government agencies, and nothing is done, you are not responsible. You have a duty to yourself and a moral obligation to uphold your NDA. If we made it admissible for people to go public even if they were bound by NDA’s the impact of their actions would be disastrous.
