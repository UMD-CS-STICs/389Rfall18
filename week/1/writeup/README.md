### Part 2 (75 pts)

Given that my job at the company was to audit the firmware for security issues, it is likely that there is some sort of process for reporting issues that was found. The first thing that I would do in this situation is follow that process and allow it to take effect. I wouldn’t immediately release the information publicly, since the fact that my position exists indicates that the company is at least doing something right in terms of security. I would report it through the proper channels within the company, whether that be the other developers, my boss, or whoever I’m told to report issues to, and see what happens in the process. In the event that the company was unwilling to take action to fix the flaw and was unwilling to postpone the ECU’s release, I would try my best to reason with the person in charge of that as quickly as I could, but if I couldn’t reason with them and get them to postpone the ECU’s release, I would feel a personal obligation to report it to the public. It would be less ethical of me to sit by and allow people to be unknowingly and unnecessarily put in danger by this insecure ECU than it would be for me to break my NDA and give the public the necessary information for them to make a responsible decision. Doing nothing could potential hurt many people, whereas speaking out and reporting the problem would only hurt myself, which is a price I would be willing to pay in order to help others.
