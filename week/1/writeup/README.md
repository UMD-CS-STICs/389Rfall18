### Part 2 (75 pts)

I would only tell my boss about the issue. This would hopefully get the company to start working on the issue as soon as possible. I would not start off by telling the public, or a consumer watchdog since that would make attackers aware of the issue. This means that they would have more time to exploit the problem. Since the security problem is “complex,” it is possible that no attacker has already figured out the issue. Also, they may not be able to figure out how to exploit the issue in the 6 months that the company is taking to fix the problem.

Ideally, the company would start working on the issue immediately and issue a recall so that the public is kept safe. A recall would help get the ECU out of the public's hands, helping to minimize harm. If the company did not tell the public, and some harm was done, legally, I would not be responsible for any harm that was caused to the public (since I reported it, the company would now be responsible). Ethically, not telling the public/ a consumer watchdog would be wrong, since telling the public myself may have prevented harm to the public.
