If my job is the review the security of a product, I believe it is right to only inform my boss. Telling no one would be wrong for few reasons. First, I would have to lie and say the product had no security flaws and push a flawed product into production. Second, the company pays me to discover security issues so it would also be a disservice to the company. Third, I am personally responsible for any harm that occurs due to my lack of disclosure. The people who are purchasing these vehicles are expecting a fully functional vehicle that has been thoroughly tested and I am exposing to risks they do not know about by telling anyone about these security flaws.Telling anyone other than my boss creates unnecessary complications. The only situation I can understand telling someone outside the company about the security flaws is if the company decides not to anything about the problem. In this case, I would find the appropriate government adminstration to report this to and leave the company. By doing this, I have done everything I need to do to ensure the safety of the consumer. I would leave the company because I would representing a company that emphasizes profit and consumer safety, which is unacceptable.
